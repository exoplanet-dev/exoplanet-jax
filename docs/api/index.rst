Public API
==========

The following pages describe the technical details of all the public-facing
members of the ``jaxoplanet`` API. This isn't meant to be introductory and, if
you're new here, the :ref:`tutorials` might be a better place to start. That
being said, we've tried to provide sufficiently detailed descriptions of all the
provided methods for once you (/we) get into the weeds. Please `open issues or
pull requests <https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/jaxoplanet/issues>`_ if you find
anything lacking.
